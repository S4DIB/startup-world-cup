# AI CTO Prompt Engineering Guide

## üéØ **Improved Prompt Engineering Strategy**

### **Key Problem Solved:**
- **Before**: AI overwhelmed founders with multiple questions at once
- **After**: AI asks ONE question at a time, building understanding progressively

## üìã **Enhanced Prompt Engineering Features**

### **1. One-Question-at-a-Time Approach**
```
‚ùå OLD: "Tell me about your idea, market, budget, team, timeline..."
‚úÖ NEW: "What's your business idea? Describe it in simple terms."
```

### **2. Progressive Information Gathering**
The AI CTO now follows a structured sequence:

1. **"What's your business idea?"** - Start with the core concept
2. **"Who is your target market?"** - Understand the customers
3. **"What problem are you solving?"** - Clarify the value proposition
4. **"What's your timeline?"** - Understand urgency and constraints
5. **"What's your budget?"** - Assess financial resources
6. **"Do you have technical background?"** - Evaluate team capabilities
7. **"What makes you unique?"** - Understand competitive advantage

### **3. Context-Aware Follow-ups**
- AI remembers previous answers
- Builds on founder's responses
- Asks relevant follow-up questions
- Shows genuine interest in their vision

### **4. Strategic Discovery Session**
- **Not an interrogation** - A collaborative discovery
- **Makes founders feel heard** - Active listening approach
- **Builds trust** - Progressive understanding
- **Leads to better advice** - Complete context before recommendations

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced System Prompt Structure:**

```javascript
CRITICAL CONVERSATION APPROACH:
1. ALWAYS ask ONE question at a time
2. Wait for their answer before moving to the next question
3. Build understanding progressively through conversation
4. Only provide comprehensive technical roadmap after gathering all necessary information

INFORMATION GATHERING SEQUENCE (ask one by one):
1. "What's your business idea? Describe it in simple terms."
2. "Who is your target market/customers?"
3. "What problem are you solving for them?"
4. "What's your timeline for launching?"
5. "What's your budget range for development?"
6. "Do you have any technical background or team?"
7. "What makes your solution unique/different?"

ONLY AFTER gathering all information:
- Provide comprehensive technical strategy
- Give specific technology recommendations
- Create actionable roadmap with timelines
- Include budget breakdown and team strategy
```

### **Conversation Flow Optimization:**
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)
- **Max Tokens**: 2048 (sufficient for detailed responses)
- **Context Memory**: Full conversation history maintained
- **Progressive Building**: Each response builds on previous context

## üéØ **Expected Conversation Flow**

### **Example 1: Food Delivery App**
```
AI CTO: "What's your business idea? Describe it in simple terms."

Founder: "I want to build a food delivery app for small restaurants"

AI CTO: "Great! I love that you're focusing on small restaurants - that's a smart niche. 
Who is your target market? Are you thinking local restaurants, specific cities, or a particular type of cuisine?"

Founder: "Local family-owned restaurants in my city"

AI CTO: "Perfect! Local family restaurants - that's a great market. 
What problem are you solving for them? What challenges do these restaurants face with delivery?"

[Conversation continues progressively...]
```

### **Example 2: SaaS Platform**
```
AI CTO: "What's your business idea? Describe it in simple terms."

Founder: "I want to build a project management tool for remote teams"

AI CTO: "Excellent! Remote teams definitely need better project management tools. 
Who is your target market? Are you thinking startups, enterprise companies, or specific industries?"

[Progressive discovery continues...]
